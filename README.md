# LIGMA-Flight-Computer

The LIGMA flight computer was created for usage on a high-powered dual deployment model rocket. 

This flight computer aims to accomplish the following:
1. Record rocket orientation
2. Record altitude
3. Deploy both the main and drogue parachutes
4. Log flight data
5. Give the user access to the flight data

This flight computer is currently in development and will be launched in the Fall of 2022 on the LIGMA model rocket in "shadow mode".
